## Cool stuff

## Project Selection or Proposal
Our project will be composed of a pvp style game that incorporates two different figures. Upon the start of the game, players will be able to choose between three different vehicles whose appearances can be customized: a tank that can shoot a bigger bullet but with a slower speed, a helicopter that can shoot 3 bullets at once but with slower speed, and a plane that can shoot an individual bullet but at a faster velocity. When spawned into the game, the players will be placed in a random location in the maze as well as when they respawn after dying. The winner is the first to get to 10 points. The project will be using PyQt as well as the PyGame API.
