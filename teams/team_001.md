## Proposal

We propose to build a web application that tracks and displays different cryptocurrency.
We would like to use CoinGecko as our API to pull data on the different currencies and
display the data in charts and other formats. We plan to allow users to create accounts
to save which currencies they would like to track. We also might give options for different
themes and customizations.
